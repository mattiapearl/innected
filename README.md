## The project itself
**The project aim:** Make a human based and community centered linking platform for entrepreneurs looking for co-founders and VCs looking for companies to invest in. 

**The technicals**: (Concept) A node-based visualized explorer. Every person could manually add or include listeners for new experiences of theirs (like github commits) which would be linked to either a *project* of theirs or their actual profile. Then, each node would be an even more explorable center of information. A visual google of people’s experience. The *projects* part could make a person show he “participated” in a company, which would back-verify him. 

Some implementation could have included user owned data through blockchain, ease of investing in someone through tokenization and quick linking to the token from the person/project profile.

**The Marketing**: We focused 100% on community. That was our objective. We built a very active group of entrepreneurs (still speaking to date) and bringed content to people through a podcast which interviewed entrepreneurs and asked them questions for beginners
